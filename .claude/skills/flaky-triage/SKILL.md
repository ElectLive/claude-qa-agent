# WAY 13 — Flaky Test Triage

## Phase 1: Aggregate
From the directory containing `playwright.config.ts` (normally `qa-artifacts/`):

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude/skills/flaky-triage/flaky.mjs" runs <window=10> .
```

The script reads the last N `runs/*/results.json` and prints, per scenario: its outcome history, flips, flip rate, a verdict (`flaky` | `consistent-fail` | `stable-pass` | `insufficient-data`), `changedDuringWindow` (the `.feature`/`.steps.ts` changed after the window started), and `unquarantine` (a quarantined test with 10 straight passes). Outcomes that say nothing about stability are excluded from the counts: `no-baseline` (first visual run) and `network`.

If there are fewer than 3 runs, say so and suggest scheduling `e2e-session` runs (or `ci-test-setup`) first.

## Phase 2: Judge (don't just trust the flip rate)

For each `flaky` scenario, read the error messages in its history:
- **Same error each time it fails** (timing, a race, animation) → real flakiness. Propose quarantine
- **Different errors** → the app or data was changing between runs, not flakiness. Leave it alone
- **`changedDuringWindow: true`** → the flips may be your own edits. Re-run triage after a few stable runs
- **`consistent-fail`** isn't flaky. It's a real failure: point to `e2e-session`/`bug-report`

## Phase 3: Quarantine (with the user's approval, per test)
1. Add `@quarantine` to the scenario's tag line in its `.feature` (keep the watermark header)
2. File a GitLab issue labeled `flaky-test` with the history table, the suspected cause, and a fix suggestion (a wait-for condition instead of a timeout, test data isolation, disabling animations). This is a **test** issue, not a product bug
3. Quarantined tests keep running. Callers just don't file bugs for them (`quarantined: true` in results), so triage can see when they stabilize

**Unquarantine:** for every `unquarantine: true` scenario, propose removing the tag and closing its `flaky-test` issue.

## Phase 4: Report
Save `./qa-artifacts/sessions/flaky-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (with the watermark footer): a table of scenario · history · flip rate · verdict · action, plus the totals.
